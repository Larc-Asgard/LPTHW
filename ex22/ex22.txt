This exercise asks me to write down list of symbols/characters mentioned in the previous exercises.
I have been making notes for this course on Google Doc.
Here is what it contains so far:

PowerShell Command
ls - list directory
cd - change directory
. (current directory)
~ (home directory)
../ (upper directory)
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove directory
re - remove


Tab - tab completion


Python
print “string”, variable1, variable2  
# - comment
operator of Python
+
-
/
*
%
<
>
<=
>=


Formatter
%s - for string
%d - for integer
%f - floating point
%r - print whatever it is


print “print within (%d, %d) %(number1, number1+1)


\n - used within string, meaing new line
\t* - list
\t - tab
(backslash is an “escaper”)


raw_input(prompt_message) is a basic input function


With:
from sys import argv
script, first, second, third = argv
Then run the script with the command line:
Python script.py variable1 variable2 variable3


It allows the script to obtain variables from the command line, put it into argv and then unpack it.


open() and variable.read() can open and read txt file


variable.read()
variable.write()
variable.truncate()
variable.close()
in which the variable is containing the txt file by
variable = open(filename, mode)


Mode for open(filename, mode):
w - write
r - read
a - append


To create a self-defined function
def function(variable):
	action()
